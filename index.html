    <p>Hello fellow class mates! My name is Ammon. I'm 25 years old and I've been married to my best friend for 3 years. We have two wonderful kids, my son was born at the end of last month and is such a joy in our lives! My daughter loves her "Baby brother" and wakes him up a lot because she wants to hold him.</p>
    <p>I love BYU-Idaho because I can take all my classes for my degree online, which makes my life a lot easier since I still work fulltime, it's really nice having that little bit of extra time with my family.</p>
    <p>A hobby of mine I've always loved is Martial Arts. My dads side has been it since my grandpa and we where raised in it my whole life. It's such a fun way to get my exercise. It's also how I met my Wife when we were kids which makes it even better!</p>
